            <h3 class="text-gray60 light lh-3 w-70 mb-4">Write clear and impactful content by being aware of our voice and tone. What we say and how we say it &ndash; reflects our attitude across our products.</h3>
            <h2>Our Voice</h2>
            <p>HealthEquity is committed to a human approach. Aspire to write using the following principles.</p>

            <ul class="mb-4">
              <li><strong>Plain spoken:</strong> Don't use jargon or needlessly big words. Aim to use short sentences and concise, simple, eye-level language.</li>
              <li><strong>Approachable:</strong> Don't talk down to anyone. Use a reassuring and positive voice for partners and members who already confront an overwhelming set of challenges.</li>
              <li><strong>Grounded:</strong> Benefits are complex. Start with the audience where they are, on their terms. Offer clear and grounded direction to members and clients.</li>
              <li><strong>Honest:</strong> Be transparent and don't take advantage of our clients. Show the "person behind the curtain" and help them make sense of the noise.</li>
              <li><strong>Thoughtful:</strong> Be direct without being condescending, more coach than teacher. HealthEquity is a leader in the industry, help our members and clients become subject matter experts, so they can make smarter choices.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Composition Strategy</h3>
            <p>Our voice and tone should represent remarkable service. To that end, work the following guiding principles into the content you write:</p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Be conversational.</strong> You're not writing a college thesis or a technical manual. You're having a conversation with the person on the other side of the screen. Imagine you're trying to explain the subject to a stranger you just met at a bus stop. What would you say? How would you say it? Write as you'd speak.</li>
              <li><strong>Be helpful.</strong> We relate to the audience most when we're empathetic, supportive, and encouraging.</li>
              <li><strong>Center the audience.</strong> Focus on the audience and their unique challenges. What pain point can your direction help them overcome?</li>
              <li><strong>Be their guide.</strong> Ask yourself why the audience cares about any of this. Put yourself in the member's shoes&ndash;what are they going through and thinking about? If you're telling me to update my contact preferences, add a beneficiary, or make a contribution, tell me why I would want to do that. What's in it for me?</li>
              <li><strong>Everything has a purpose.</strong> Your communication isn't an end in itself. It's an open door to help people accomplish something important.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Remember, you are not your target audience.</p>
            <p>Check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style" target="_blank">The Elements of Style</a> by William Strunk Jr. for a complete writing style guide.</p>
            <p class="w-70">Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. This requires not that the writer make all his sentences short, or that he avoid all detail and treat his subjects only in outline, but that he make every word tell.</p>
